ReadMe file
In assignment3, I build two views, first one has several widgets
to post username and message content. then there is a button to submit
if submitted successful, there will come out a toast. The second button is
for going to message center(second view), it will come out the list of messages
that is stored in the messagehub in descending order. (here you must use my assignment2 to test, since I 
parsed the html, so I think it won't work for other message html file).
